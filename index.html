      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate software engineer who loves making products that have a
        positive impact on people's lives. I graduated from UC Davis in June
        2023 with a bachelors degree in computer science and worked as both a
        research and teaching assistant during my studies. Since graduating, I
        have been contributing to projects ranging from full-stack mobile
        development to test automation and embedded software engineering. I've
        been fortunate to learn from talented, hard-working professors and
        engineers, and look forward to applying those lessons to continue making
        products that people can rely on.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me painting, exploring new
        technologies, or contributing to open-source projects. I'm always eager
        to learn and take on new challenges that allow me to grow both
        personally and professionally.

              During my senior year at UC Davis, I worked alongside a team of
              engineers from the Davis Data Science Club to create a product
              that could detect sign language from a user via webcam and
              translate what they were gesturing to english in real-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our tech stack included <b>Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV</b>. We
              overcame challenges in enhancing model training, model efficiency,
              achieving real-time processing, and refining user interface
              design. At the end of the quarter, we presented the project to the
              club and successfully displayed its ability to tranlsate sign
              language gestures in real time.
